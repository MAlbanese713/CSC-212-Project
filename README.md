# CSC-212-Project
Coding Project for CSC 212

String Search 1:

Implementation of algorithms:

  Rabin-Karp 

  Boyer-Moore 

Benchmark algorithms according to their runtime

Generate plots of running time on multiple sizes


Instructions on downloading/compiling code and running:

Algorithms by themselves:

1. Download and compile Either Rabin-Karp or Boyer-Moore and run individually (single file).
2. Run the code after compiling.
3. If you want to change the string that is being searched (or the pattern), manually edit it within the code and compile + run.

GUI Implementation:

1. If Rabin-Karp and Boyer-Moore are not in C#, convert from cpp file to c# using cpp file implementations.
2. If you want to use the pre-existing C# file translated for the GUI, skip step 1.
3. Have Microsoft Visual Studio available for use with .NET library for C# installed (it is based off of Windows Forms in C#).
4. Download and implement the 'GUIForm Code' file and 'GUIForm Designer Code' files.
5. Implement both files, GUIForm is the running code of the form, and GUIForm Designer Code sets up the visuals of the form. Run the GUIForm Code file after implementing.
6. Select an algorithm on the form to run by selecting one of the radio buttons.
7. Input a pattern to search for as well as a string to search through in their respective text boxes.
8. Press the Start button.
9. Look at the output.
